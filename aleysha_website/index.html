    	So you've decided that you have a PC or console good enough to stream on the broadcasting website Twitch but you're unsure where to go or how things work? Well once you have the drive to stream, some free time in your schedule and a few good games to play you just need some software to get you on your way. Below is a quick summary of what you need to get started.

    <div id="title1">
    	What do I need?
    </div>
    
    <div id="panels">
    	<div class="flexbox" id="panel-flex"> 
    		<div class="panel flexbox" id="panel1">
    			<div class="panel-title">Twitch</div>
    			<div class="panel-img" id="panel-img1"><img src="twitch_dashboard.png"/></div>
    			<div class="panel-text">First of all you need a Twitch account, go to www.twitch.tv and click create an account. Once you have done this go to your dashboard and begin setting it up. Your twitch dashboard is where you go for everything. From your dashboard you can controll your stream titles and what audience you're broadcasting to. You can also see your previous stream summeries and edit all your channel settings. </div>
    		</div>
    		<div class="panel flexbox" id="panel2">
    			<div class="panel-title">OBS</div>
    			<div class="panel-img" id="panel-img2"><img src="obs.png"/></div>
    			<div class="panel-text">You will need some sort of capturing software, personally I recommend OBS as it is the best free recording software that is widely used by the majority of streamers. Once you've downloaded the broadcast software of your choice, take the time to explore the settings and then feel free to experiment. Choose your favorite PC game and host a few practice streams. After a while maybe start looking at putting some overlays on your stream.</div>
