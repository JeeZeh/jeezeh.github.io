                This was my first foray into Illustrator. It proved difficult, especially as the source image was not a vector - I was also
                very much stuck in the mindset of photoshop!

                This one was really fun. I started out wanting something bright and loud with sharp edges, but then I remembered about double-exposure
                immitation in Photoshop. I thought I'd have a bit of a play with it and this is the end result. Through the
                process it became a lot darker and <em>indie-er</em> than I had planned.

                I'd never designed an ID badge before, so I thought this would be an interesting one to try. The positioning of the details
                was actually the trickiest part of this project.</div>

                    This was the project that started <em>Graphics Tasks</em>. With this project I realised that doing portfolio work could be fun, and not just work.
                    The idea of a 404 page for Kanye West was so bizarre that I couldn't pass up giving it a go. Since one of Kanye's more popular releases was call <em>808s and Heartbreak</em>,
                    I thought it would be a good idea to play with that.

                        I probably put more work into this project than any of the others here. It was a submission to EVGA's anniversary wallpaper competition.
                        Unfortunately, it didn't win, but I learned a lot about recreating real objects in 2d and experiemented with positioning for quite some time before
                        I came to this result. The full process from start to finish is detailed on my Behance!
