                    This was my first foray into Illustrator. It proved difficult, especially as the source image was not a vector - I was also
                    very much stuck in the mindset of photoshop!

                    This one was really fun. I started out wanting something bright and loud with sharp edges, but then I remembered about double-exposure
                    immitation in Photoshop. I thought I'd have a bit of a play with it and this is the end result. Through
                    the process it became a lot darker and
                    <em>indie-er</em> than I had planned.

                    I'd never designed an ID badge before, so I thought this would be an interesting one to try. The positioning of the details
                    was actually the trickiest part of this project.</div>

                    This was the project that started
                    <em>Graphics Tasks</em>. I realised that doing portfolio work could be fun, and not just work. The idea of
                    a 404 page for Kanye West was so cool that I couldn't pass up giving it a go. Since one of Kanye's more
                    popular releases was called
                    <em>808s and Heartbreak</em>, I thought it would be a good idea to play with that.

                    I probably put more work into this project than any of the others here. It was a submission to EVGA's anniversary wallpaper
                    competition. It didn't win, but I learned a lot about recreating real objects in 2D and experiemented
                    with positioning for before I came to this result. The full process from start to finish is detailed
                    on my Behance!
